            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Hello! I'm <span class="font-semibold">Lokesh Viswanadham</span>, a dedicated Mechanical Engineer driven by a profound commitment to solving complex engineering challenges, optimising systems for peak performance, and contributing to sustainable solutions. My academic journey at Cranfield University culminated in an MSc in Advanced Mechanical Engineering, where I cultivated expertise across critical domains including Risk and Reliability Management, Advanced Materials and Corrosion, Project Management, Finite Element Analysis (ABAQUS), Product Design, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (ANSYS ICEM).
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                My Master's research particularly highlights my dedication to clean energy innovation. My Master's thesis focused on the commissioning of a supercritical CO2 test rig, inspired by the innovative Allam Cycle. This involved extensive literature research into the cycle's operational processes and its advanced carbon capture technology, which achieves an impressive operational efficiency of 68% in a supercritical CO2 medium. Recognising the cost implications of using Nickel-based superalloys like CMSX-4 in the original design, my core objective was to conduct in-depth research into viable carbon steel alternatives. This detailed exploration aimed to significantly reduce rig setup costs, thereby enhancing the accessibility and promotion of green energy solutions. My work involved a rigorous examination of carbon steel corrosion behaviour in supercritical CO2 environments, underscoring my ability to tackle intricate material science challenges with a clear focus on practical and sustainable outcomes.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Complementing my robust theoretical foundation, I have gained invaluable practical experience as a Technical Operations Lead at Waitrose & Partners. In this dynamic environment, I have applied my engineering expertise to ensure the safe and efficient operation of mechanical handling equipment, including reach trucks and low-level order pickers. My responsibilities included rigorous pre-check lists, precise defect reporting to technical teams, and crucially, leading diverse teams of 10-15 individuals to consistently meet operational demands while strictly adhering to health and safety regulations.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Currently, I am further expanding my analytical capabilities through a Data Apprenticeship, demonstrating my commitment to continuous learning and skill diversification. This involves hands-on experience in data cleaning and manipulation, building effective interactive dashboards for visualisation using Tableau, leveraging Python for advanced data analytics, training machine learning models, and applying time series forecasting for predictive insights. Throughout this, I maintain strict adherence to GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018, ensuring data integrity and compliance. I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my comprehensive skill set and passion for innovation within the mechanical engineering sector, where my analytical capabilities serve as a valuable addition to areas focused on advanced materials, energy systems, and operational excellence.
